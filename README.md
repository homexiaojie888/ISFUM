# ISFUM
This repo hosts the code for paper "Incremental skyline frequent-utility itemset mining", Xiaojie Zhanga, Guoting Chen, Linqi Song, Wensheng, 2023.

# Requirements
Java programming language.

# Running the program
A simple way is to run MainTestHEPMAlgorithm_saveToFile.java and MainTestHEPMinerAlgorithm_saveToFile.

# Benchmarks
The data format used is the same as in the file DB_Utility.txt and Stock.txt. Additional datasets like DB_Utility.txt can be accessed from SPMF; Additional datasets like Stock.txt can be generated by GenInvest.java.
Introduction
The HEPM and HEPMiner algorithms are proposed to efficiently mine high-efficiency itemsets.
